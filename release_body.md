## Installation
- Extract the contents of the release zip in to the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**steamapps\common\Soul Hackers 2**" for Steam).
- Run the game once to generate a config file located at **<GameDirectory>\BepinEx\config\SoulHackers2Fix.cfg**
- The first launch may take a little while as BepInEx does its magic.

## Configuration
